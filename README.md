# Train the Best Sentence Embedding Model Ever with 1B Training Pairs.

## Dataset

The iteration on the dataset are crucial for this task as the characteristics of the batch will directly impact on the model performances.
**Increasing the batch size** will increase performances as well [Qu and all., 2021](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.naacl-main.466.pdf).
Each batch should also be somehow **center on one specific sub-domain** or dataset such that samples could not be discriminated from their general "domain" only.
However batches should **also mix different sub-domains in some proportion** such that the mapping of distinct domain do not overlap.

I implemented basic function to download the various corpora and load them in python. Download time should be approximatively 20 minutes for all datasets currently listed in the "Available Datasets" sheet. 
I also implemented a basic lazy dataloader. For now the dataloader takes a single `jsonl.gz` file as input and iterates over it to retrieve sample.
The dataloader is implemented in `PyTorch` for now and support multi-threading. It uses a pointer mechanism to load a sample one by one in memory.
